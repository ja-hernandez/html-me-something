INSTRUCTIONS
Wash and pick through the beans, removing any bits of debris or broken beans, and place them in a colander. Rinse and drain under cold water until the water runs clear. Drain.
Combine the beans, onion, garlic, and bay leaves in a 6-quart or larger slow cooker and add enough water to cover the beans by at least 2 inches. Cover and cook on the LOW setting for 6 to 8 hours until the beans are tender but not mushy or falling apart, checking after 3 hours for doneness. If the beans are not done, continue cooking. Add more water as needed so that there is least 2 inches of water covering the beans at all times. This will help the beans to cook more evenly. Remove and discard the onion and bay leaves. Taste and season with salt as needed.
Serve warm in large bowls garnished with cilantro, tomatoes, and crema, or a sprinkle of the queso fresco if desired.
